# Blockchain (JavaScript)

This project is a blockchain server-client node implementation in JavaScript.

## Overview of the Mockchain structure

The project focuses on implementation of the chain itself and functionality
surrounding it as a list. To this end, hashing functions and chain validation is
the major focus.

The project is simply interactive through the browser, and can be accessed at
the following endpoints:

-   `/mine`: A new block is generated and added to the listing.
-   `/chain`: The full chain is printed out.
-   `/newtransaction`: A new transaction is generated, from a mock source IP to
    a mock destination IP.
-   `/validate`: The chain on the node is validated for correctness.
-   `/listtransactions`: All transactions are listed out.
-   `/brew`: The server attempts to brew coffee.

These more demonstrate the functionality of blockchain as a data structure. More
emphasis on network and connectivity is covered in other projects.
